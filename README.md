IfcValidator
==========

Checking IFC models on the quality of the data.
Implemented parts of the Dutch "Rijksgebouwendienst BIM norm" as an example.

## Checks

A list of checks that have been identified by asking people from the building industry and reading Dutch "norm" documents that seem computer checkable.
