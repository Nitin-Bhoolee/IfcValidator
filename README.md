IfcValidator
==========

This is a BIMserver plugin that checks Ifc2x3tc1 models for common requirements.

> Note: This plugin needs BIMserver 1.5

The plugin generates [Extended Data](https://github.com/opensourceBIM/BIMserver/wiki/Extended-Data) according to the following [Validation Report](https://github.com/opensourceBIM/BIMserver-Repository/wiki/Validation-Report) format.

## Checks

A list of checks that have been identified by asking people from the building industry and reading Dutch "norm" documents that seem computer checkable.
